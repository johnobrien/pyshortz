Name something that might be worn on the foot. 

Change one letter in it without changing the 
order of the other letters. The result 
will name something one might wear on the 
upper part of the body. What is it? 

Here's a hint: The thing on the upper part 
of the body is a two-word phrase.

I'm sick of trying to come up w/ lists 
of things that are worn on the upper body
or whatever.

New plan: download a dictionary of all words,
and search their definitions to get words that
contain arbitrary words in their definition.

Dictionary of words to download:
https://github.com/adambom/dictionary

How to search for words within the values of dictionaries:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17340922/how-to-search-if-dictionary-value-contains-certain-string-with-python

Rough sketch: download the JSON, 
load it into a shelf, and search it.
Probably add it to the "setup" page.
